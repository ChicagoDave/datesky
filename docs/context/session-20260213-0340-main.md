# Session Summary: 2026-02-13 - main

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Initialize the DateSky project repository
- Document the core concept and vision
- Define the AT Protocol lexicon schema for dating profiles

## Completed

### Project Initialization
- Created git repository with initial commit
- Established basic project structure with documentation and lexicon directories
- Added `.gitignore` with common Node.js and database exclusions

### Concept Documentation
- Created comprehensive concept document at `docs/start.md` detailing:
  - Core idea: open dating profiles on AT Protocol/Bluesky infrastructure
  - Key value propositions (real identity, data sovereignty, existing trust signals, no walled garden)
  - Discovery mechanism via freeform tags and community-curated lists
  - Privacy considerations and public-by-default nature of atproto records
  - Initial roadmap: schema → web UI → early adopters → organic growth

### Lexicon Schema Definition
- Created `lexicons/app/datesky/profile.json` implementing `app.datesky.profile` record type
- Record keyed as `literal:self` (enforcing one profile per account)
- Defined 10 profile fields with appropriate constraints:
  - **displayName**: 64 graphemes max
  - **bio**: 1024 graphemes max (free-form dating bio)
  - **photos**: Array of up to 6 image blobs with required alt text
  - **intentions**: Array of up to 5 strings with known values (dating/friends/casual/long-term)
  - **location**: 128 graphemes max (freeform)
  - **gender**: 64 graphemes max (freeform)
  - **pronouns**: 32 graphemes max (freeform)
  - **age**: Integer with minimum value of 18
  - **tags**: Array of up to 32 freeform strings (64 graphemes each) for discovery
  - **createdAt**: Required datetime field
- Defined `photo` object type with image blob constraints:
  - Accepts: image/png, image/jpeg, image/webp
  - Max size: 1MB per image
  - Required alt text (256 graphemes max)

## Key Decisions

### 1. Build on AT Protocol Rather Than Standalone System
**Rationale**: Leverages existing Bluesky identity (handles/DIDs), social graph, trust signals (mutual follows, post history), and messaging infrastructure (DMs). Eliminates cold-start problem and provides built-in trust mechanisms that traditional dating apps struggle to establish.

### 2. Freeform Tags Instead of Controlled Vocabulary
**Rationale**: Allows organic emergence of conventions from actual usage. More flexible for niche communities and identities. Users can self-describe in their own terms rather than fitting into predetermined categories. Tag discovery will naturally surface popular conventions.

### 3. Public-by-Default Profile Records
**Rationale**: AT Protocol records are inherently public. Being transparent about this from the start sets appropriate expectations. Users who need privacy can opt out, and future privacy primitives from the atproto ecosystem can be adopted as they emerge.

### 4. No Matching Requirement for Contact
**Rationale**: Removes artificial gates present in traditional dating apps. If both parties are on Bluesky, they can already DM each other. The social graph and profile visibility provide sufficient context for initiating conversation without forced mutual consent gates.

### 5. One Profile Per Account (literal:self key)
**Rationale**: Ties dating profile directly to established Bluesky identity, preventing multi-profile spam and catfishing. Maintains accountability through connection to user's social history and network.

## Open Items

### Short Term
- Design and build a web UI for creating/editing `app.datesky.profile` records
- Implement profile browsing by tags
- Implement profile discovery via lists
- Create initial example profiles for testing
- Set up development environment and tooling

### Long Term
- Recruit early adopters from Bluesky community
- Develop moderation guidelines and community standards
- Explore integration with Bluesky's labeling/moderation infrastructure
- Monitor tag usage patterns and document emerging conventions
- Consider unlisted profile options as atproto privacy features evolve
- Build tooling for list curators
- Create documentation for developers wanting to build alternative UIs

## Files Created

**Documentation** (1 file):
- `docs/start.md` - Comprehensive concept document explaining DateSky vision, mechanics, lexicon overview, privacy considerations, and roadmap

**Lexicon Schema** (1 file):
- `lexicons/app/datesky/profile.json` - AT Protocol lexicon definition for dating profile record type

**Configuration** (1 file):
- `.gitignore` - Standard exclusions for node_modules, .env files, and database files

## Architectural Notes

### AT Protocol Integration Points
The design leverages several atproto primitives:
- **Records**: Dating profiles stored as `app.datesky.profile` records in user PDSs
- **DIDs/Handles**: Existing Bluesky identity prevents fake accounts
- **Social Graph**: Mutual follows provide trust signals
- **Blobs**: Photos stored as blob references with accessibility (alt text) as first-class concern
- **Lists**: Community curation mechanism already exists in Bluesky ecosystem

### Schema Design Philosophy
The lexicon embraces flexibility over rigidity:
- Nearly all fields optional (only `createdAt` required) - users share what they're comfortable with
- Freeform text for gender, pronouns, location - no forced categorization
- `knownValues` on intentions suggests common patterns without enforcing them
- Generous limits on array sizes and text lengths to avoid artificial constraints

### Discovery Strategy
Multi-layered approach to profile discovery:
1. **Freeform tags** - self-applied, organic taxonomy
2. **Community-curated lists** - leverages existing Bluesky list infrastructure
3. **Social graph** - see who your follows are on DateSky
4. **Tag search** - direct query by interests/identities

This avoids centralized algorithmic matching while providing multiple pathways for serendipitous discovery.

## Notes

**Session duration**: Initial commit (foundation work)

**Approach**: Concept-first development - established clear vision and data model before implementation. The schema balances structure (for interoperability) with flexibility (for diverse user needs and organic evolution).

**Philosophy**: This is infrastructure, not a product. Success means creating an open standard that others can build upon, not controlling the user experience or data.
